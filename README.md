# JetsProject

Welcome to the Jets application, where you have the opportunity to create and manage your own fleet of jets. This program allows you to perform various functions such as adding new jets to the existing fleet, show-casing the fastest jet, identifying jets with the longest range, and more!

## Instructions
To use the program, follow these simple steps:
1. Run the program as a Java application or compile it using the `javac` command from the terminal and then execute it.
2. Once the program opens, you can use the interactive menu to perform the following tasks:
   - **1:** Navigate through the interface.
   - **2:** List the initial fleet of planes.
   - **3:** Add or remove planes.
   - **4:** Display the fastest plane or the plane with the longest travel range.
   - **5:** Load cargo planes or engage in Dogfights with fighter jets.
   - **6:** Quit the application.

**Notes:**
- After selecting any option, the program will execute the task and prompt you to return to the main menu by pressing **1**.
- Choosing an invalid option from the menu will exit the program.
- The provided calculations are not accurate and are for the purpose of the assignment.

##Technologies Used
This program was written all in Java. The main techniques used to write it were Array lists, encapsulation, loops, switch statements, inheritance and a variety of methods. 
##Lessons Learned
Array lists are a bit complicated, more often than not I was scratching my head as to how to make use of the array list. Moreover, I tried to keep my code dry by using different methods but I wrote a lot of those methods before testing the app. Next time I should only write one method at a time not to confuse myself. Applying the extends and implement functions to my classes was confusing, specially because of interfaces. Overall, I was challenged by this project but I learned a lot from my mistakes.

Note: Had to learn how to format using a String.format method amongst other stuff from stack over flow.
